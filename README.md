# Mastermind API

## Scrapyard
hi scrapyard reviewers! thanks for reviewing my project! here's two other ships i'm also proud of, but couldn't decide between for the application:
- [SignSync](https://github.com/fyrebolt/lahacks) - a team project for Los Altos Hacks VIII that uses JavaScript to convert ASL hand movement from a camera into written English
-  [BitConnect](https://github.com/pbhak/phv-bitconnect) - an API that automatically generates balanced workouts based on input (i.e. how many reps of a particular exercise you can do)
-  [Battleships](https://github.com/pbhak/battleships-api) - an API that serves as a wrapper for the popular gane Battleships (similar to this one!)

Want to read more about this API and see the docs? [Here's the site!](https://mastermind.apidocumentation.com/)

An API wrapper for Mastermind made for RaspAPI - https://raspapi.hackclub.com
